## Future
This is a simple project just to demonstrate what i can do with Flask. However, it is important to address that the Face Swap algorithm is **not** mine. It was forked a long time ago from someone on github. I have lost that person's details. Approach For algorithm credits if it is indeed your model. I just modified the algorithm and ported it to the web using Flask.
Let me see what i can do going forward! I have already built a Desktop version using PyQt5 and had used it for my school annual project exhibition called Prayoga
